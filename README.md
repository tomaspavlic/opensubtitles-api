> With Covid-19 pandemic requests for our API went skyrocket, our servers could not handle so much traffic, so we decided to limit API usage just to authenticated requests for User Agents. In short it means, you have to provide opensubtitles.org username and password in LogIn() method.

## Installation
```bash
## .NET CLI
dotnet add package Topdev.OpenSubtitles.Client

## Package Manager
Install-Package Topdev.OpenSubtitles.Client
```

## Usage
```
var openSubtitlesApi = new OpenSubtitlesApi();

openSubtitlesApi.LogIn("eng", "OSTestUserAgentTemp");

var subtitles = openSubtitlesApi.FindSubtitles(
    SearchMethod.Qeury,
    "Game of thrones s01e01",
    "eng");

openSubtitlesApi.DownloadSubtitle(
    subtitles[0],
    null);
```
